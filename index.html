    <h2>Diving in</h2><br>
    <p>What is an offline web application?
      At first glance, it sounds like a contradiction in terms.
      Web pages are things you download and render.
      Downloading implies a network connection.
      How can you download when you’re offline? Of course, you can’t.
      But you <em>can</em> download when you’re online.
      And that’s how HTML5 offline applications work.</p><br>
    <p>
      At its simplest, an offline web application is a list of URLs — HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
      images, or any other kind of resource. The home page of the offline web application
      points to this list, called a manifest file, which is just a text file located
      elsewhere on the web server. A web browser that implements HTML5 offline
      applications will read the list of URLs from the manifest file, download the resources,
      cache them locally, and automatically keep the local copies up to date as they change.
      When the time comes that you try to access the web application without a network connection,
      your web browser will automatically switch over to the local copies instead.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      From there, most of the work is up to you, the web developer.
      There’s a flag in the DOM that will tell you whether you’re online or offline.
      There are events that fire when your offline status changes (one minute you’re offline and the next minute
      you’re
      online, or vice-versa).
      But that’s pretty much it. If your application creates data or saves state,
      it’s up to you to <a href="">store that data locally</a> while you’re offline and synchronize it with the remote
      server once you’re back online.
      In other words, HTML5 can take your web application offline.
      What you do once you’re there is up to you.

    <h2>The Cache Manifest</h2>
    <p>
      An offline web application revolves around a cache manifest file.
      What’s a manifest file? It’s a list of all of the resources that your web application
      might need to access while it’s disconnected from the network.
      In order to bootstrap the process of downloading and caching these resources,
      you need to point to the manifest file, using a <code>manifest</code>
      attribute on your <code>&#60;html&#62;</code> element.
    </p>
    <pre>
            <code>
                &#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;
                &#60;html manifest="/cache.manifest"&#62;
                &#60;body&#62;
                ...
                &#60;/body&#62;
                &#60;/html&#62;
            </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
      Your cache manifest file can be located anywhere on your web server,
      but it must be served with the content type <code>text/cache-manifest</code>.
      If you are running an Apache-based web server,
      you can probably just put <a href="">an AddType directive</a> in the
      <code>.htaccess</code>file at the root of your web directory:
    </p>
    <pre>
          <code>
              AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest
          </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
      Then make sure that the name of your cache manifest file ends with <code>.manifest</code>.
      If you use a different web server or a different configuration of Apache,
      consult your server’s documentation on controlling the <code>Content-Type</code> header.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Let’s Build One!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Remember the Halma game that we introduced in <a href="">the canvas chapter</a> and later improved
      by <a href="">saving state with persistent local storage</a>? Let’s take our Halma game offline.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do that, we need a manifest that lists all the resources the game needs. Well,
      there’s the main HTML page, a single JavaScript file that contains all the game code, and… that’s it.
      There are no images, because all the drawing is done programmatically via the <a href="">canvas API</a>.
      All the necessary CSS styles are in a <code>&#60;style&#62;</code>element at the top of the HTML page.
      So this is our cache manifest:
    </p>
    <pre>
          <code>
              CACHE MANIFEST
              halma.html
              ../halma-localstorage.js
          </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
      A word about paths. I’ve created an <code>offline/</code> subdirectory in the
      <code>examples/</code> directory, and this cache manifest file lives inside the subdirectory.
      Because the HTML page will need one minor addition to work offline (more on that in a minute),
      I’ve created a separate copy of the HTML file, which also lives in the <code>offline/</code>
      subdirectory. But because there are no changes to the JavaScript code itself since
      <a href="">we added local storage support</a>, I’m literally reusing the same <code>.js</code>
      file , which lives in the parent directory <code>(examples/)</code>.
      Altogether, the files look like this:
    </p>
    <code>
            /examples/localstorage-halma.html
            /examples/halma-localstorage.js
            /examples/offline/halma.manifest
            /examples/offline/halma.html
        </code>
    <p>
      In the cache manifest file <code>(/examples/offline/halma.manifest)</code>,
      we want to reference two files. First, the offline version of the HTML file
      <code>(/examples/offline/halma.html)</code>. Since these two files are in the same directory,
      it is listed in the manifest file without any path prefix. Second, the JavaScript
      file which lives in the parent directory <code>(/examples/halma-localstorage.js)</code>. This is
      listed in the manifest file using relative URL notation: <code>../halma-localstorage.js</code>.
      This is just like you might use a relative URL in an <code>&#60;img src&#62;</code> attribute. As you’ll
      see in the next example, you can also use absolute paths (that start at the root of the current domain)
      or even absolute URLs (that point to resources on other domains).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in the HTML file, we need to add the <code>manifest</code> attribute that points to the cache manifest file.
    </p>
    <pre>
          <code>
              &#60;!doctype html&#62;
              &#60;html lang="en" manifest="halma.manifest"&#62;
          </code>
        </pre>
    <p>
      And that’s it! When an offline-capable browser first loads <a href=="">the offline-enabled HTML page</a>,
      it will download the linked cache manifest file and start downloading all the referenced resources
      and storing them in the offline application cache. From then on, the offline application algorithm
      takes over whenever you revisit the page. You can play the game offline,
      and since it remembers its state locally, you can leave and come back as often as you like.
